# Fixed-Point-Vs-Floating-Point
#Tasked performed

In Makefile folder directories with name as given below has been created. 
 -include
 -lib 
 -src 
 -obj 
 -bin 
1 Makefile created

2 Lib directory contains fixedptc.h file 

3 src directory contains fixedpt_print, matrix.c and print_matrix.c 

4 obj directory contains all the object files created when .c files are executed 

5 bin directory contain the executable file 

6 Implemented fixed point multiplication and floating point multiplication in c & matlab 

7 Dimension of every matrix is changing by 5 

8 Every time a random matrix is generated 

9 Random matrix is multiplied with itself and the time it takes to calculate is noted down to file 

10 Time is calculated for both floating point and fixed-point matrix multiplication 

11 Graph plotted using gnu plot in which time is y axis and log of dimension is x axis 

12 In terminal window we only have type make INT=”Value Of Maximum Dimension” and graph 
will be generated and will also get saved in Makefile directory 

13 Graph has been plotted in matlab to compare performance of C and Matlab
